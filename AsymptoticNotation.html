    <h1>Asymptotic Analysis</h1>

    <p>Asymptotic analysis is a method of analyzing the performance of an algorithm by studying its behavior as the input size approaches infinity. It helps us understand how an algorithm's running time or memory usage changes as the input size grows.</p>

    <h3>There are three main notations used in asymptotic analysis:</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    Big O (Upper bound): O(n) represents the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or memory usage. It gives the worst-case scenario.
    Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), it means the running time will not exceed n^2 as the input size increases.
    Big Ω (Lower bound): Ω(n) represents the lower bound of an algorithm's running time or memory usage. It gives the best-case scenario.
    Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of Ω(n), it means the running time will not be less than n as the input size increases.
    Big Θ (Tight bound): Θ(n) represents the tight bound of an algorithm's running time or memory usage. It gives both the upper and lower bounds.
    Example: If an algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(n log n), it means the running time will be exactly proportional to n log n as the input size increases.

    Common Asymptotic Notations
    O(1) - Constant time complexity
    O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity
    O(n) - Linear time complexity
    O(n log n) - Linearithmic time complexity
    O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity
    O(2^n) - Exponential time complexity
    O(n!) - Factorial time complexity
    Understanding asymptotic analysis and notation is crucial in DSA as it helps you:
    Analyze the performance of algorithms
    Compare the efficiency of different algorithms
    Predict the running time and memory usage of an algorithm for large inputs
    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
